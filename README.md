#Finding Frequent Item sets

###Overview

The main aim of the project is to <strong>find frequent item sets</strong> in an <strong>optimised way</strong> for a <strong>large data set</strong> using very <strong>limited memory</strong>.

In this Project, 3 different algorithms are implemented to find frequent item-sets namely <strong>Park-Chen-Yu (PCY), Multi-Stage hashing and Toivonen</strong>. The transactions are given as an input file - <a href="https://github.com/NandanNayak/Finding-Frequent-Item-Sets/blob/master/input.txt">input.txt</a>.

###Problem 1: PCY Algorithm and Execution

<strong>Implementation</strong>
Implementing PCY algorithm using a single hash and printing all frequent item sets. Each letter(alphabet) is assigned a value. The hash function calculates the sum of the values for pairs and so on and takes the mod with respect to the bucket size.

<strong>Executing code</strong>

<em>python nayak_nandan_pcy.py input2.txt 3 20</em>

<strong>Input Parameters:</strong>

1. <em>Input.txt</em>: This is the input file containing all transactions. Each line corresponds to a transaction. Each transaction has items that are comma separated. 

2. <em>Support (3)</em>: Integer that defines the minimum count to qualify as a frequent itemset.

3. <em>Bucket size (20)</em>: This is the size of the hash table.

<strong>Output</strong>: The output contains the frequent itemsets generated in each pass sorted lexicographically. It contains information about the memory usage during each pass over the data along with the hash buckets and their counts (Assume each count takes 4 bytes).

<strong>Sample Output</strong>

<em>memory for item counts: 48

memory for hash table counts for size 2 itemsets: 80

{0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 12: 0, 13: 0, 14: 0, 15: 0, 16: 0, 17: 0, 18: 0, 19: 0}

frequent item sets of size 1 :  [['e']]

PASS : 2

memory for frequent itemsets of size 1 : 8

bitmap size : 20

frequent item sets of size 2 :  []</em>

Here for the 1st pass we show the memory used for the item counts, hash table counts, hash_buckets with their counts and frequent itemsets found respectively. As there are no frequent itemsets of size 2, we do not output anything for subsequent passes.

###Problem 2: Multi-Stage Hashing Algorithm

<strong>Implementation</strong>

Implementing the Multi-Stage algorithm to generate frequent itemsets. There are two stages using two different hashing functions for finding frequent itemsets of each size. Usng hashing functions which are independent of each other. Both the hashes will have the same number of buckets. Also while finding frequent pairs, all the possible pairs are hashed but the frequent itemsets of size >= 3, as we know the frequent itemsets of size-1. The counts in the buckets can vary depending on the hashing function used.

###Problem 3: Toivonen Algorithm
Implementing the Toivonen algorithm to generate frequent itemsets. For this algorithm we have used a sample size of less than 60% of your entire dataset. Also a simple Apriori algorithm is implemented with the random sample set. After Checking for negative borders, the algorithm is executed again with a different sample set ifrequired till there are no negative borders that have frequency > support.

<strong>Note:</strong> The number of iterations might differ in your output depending on the random sample which is generated.

<strong>Input Parameters:</strong>

1. Input.txt: This is the input file containing all transactions. Each line corresponds to a transaction. Each transaction has items that are comma separated. Use toivonen_test.txt to test this algorithm.

2. Support: Integer that defines the minimum count to qualify as a frequent itemset.

<strong>Executing code</strong>

<em>python nayak_nandan_toivonen.py toivonen_test.txt 20</em>

<strong>Output:</strong>
<em>

Line 1 (number of iterations performed)

Line 2 (fraction of transactions used)

Line 3 onwards (frequent itemsets lexicographically sorted)</em>
